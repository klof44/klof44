# Hi

I'm a dude who plays videogames and codes in mostly c#.  
Don't be afraid to reach out for literally any reason.  
I'm a student hoping to go into computer science.  
You can reach my by adding me on discord at `klof44#6612` or emailing me at `klof4four@gmail.com`.  
  
## Project(s)

The only big project I'm a part of right now is Duck Game Rebuilt which is under heavy development and might release one day.

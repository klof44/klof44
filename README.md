## Projects

### Duck Game Rebuilt

https://github.com/TheFlyingFoool/DuckGameRebuilt  
The new way to play Duck Game with an immense ammount of changes that nobody will notice, plus a few visible ones.  

### Hat Database

https://github.com/klof44/HatDatabase  
A centralized place for all Duck Game hats.  
I work on it every now and again but it's nowhere near a release.

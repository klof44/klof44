# Hi

I'm a dude who plays videogames, codes in mostly c# and is a student.  
Don't be afraid to reach out for literally any reason.  
You can reach me by adding me on discord at `klof44#6612` or emailing me at `klof4four@gmail.com`.  
  
## Project(s)

The only big project I'm a part of right now is Duck Game Rebuilt which is under heavy development and might release one day.
